# ![alt tag](./src/images/smiley-crown.svg) Usabilla Balls of Fire

We developed this game for fun. [eCommerce](http://www.amsterdameweek.com/) attendees had the opportunity to experience it live.

Setup is as easy as

```sh
$ npm i
```

To build game for production

```sh
$ npm run build
```

`dist` contains all static files, which you can then distribute.

For development

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

which will spawn a webserver with livereload.
